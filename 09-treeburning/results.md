### Results
1. Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?

   I chose this board size because there's a vast amount of space for the fire to spread. Using this board size gave me a solid average result.
2. Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?

   I chose 100 as my repetition because it returned more precise result and it was comparable and observable for behavioral pattern.
3. What did your testing show about changing the board size?

   Increasing the board size clarified the density of where the maximum burn time is located.
4. Knowing that there were differences based on board size, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?

   As the board size increased the burn time increased at mid density. I tested this by printing results of different boards size of various densities.
5. What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?

   The maximum burn time is yielded at density of 60%.
